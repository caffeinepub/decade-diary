{
  "frontend/src/index.css": "Global styles with warm OKLCH color palette, Playfair Display + Lato typography, background texture, and warm component utilities — with the `border-border/60` opacity modifier replaced by a plain CSS `border-color` property to fix the PostCSS `@apply` build error.",
  "frontend/tailwind.config.js": "Extended Tailwind config with Playfair Display/Lato fonts, warm color tokens, custom shadows, fade-in animation, and a new `pastel-brown` color token (DEFAULT, light, dark) for the Today's Inspiration section.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts": "All React Query hooks for backend operations — fully restored with all previously missing exports: `CoupleCreateErrorException` class, `useGetDailyQuote`, `useUpdateWaterIntake`, `useDeleteDailyPlannerEntry`, `useGetPartnerDailyPlannerEntries`, and all planner/journal hooks. Also includes the new `useGetPartnerJournals(enabled)` hook that fetches all four partner journal types via `actor.getPartnerJournals()`, gated on couple membership.",
  "frontend/src/App.tsx": "Main app with TanStack Router, navigation bar branding updated to \"Future Us\" with a 💑 logo icon, profile setup modal welcome text updated to \"Future Us\", landing screen hero updated to \"Your Future Together\" with couple-focused copy, footer copyright updated to \"Future Us\", and all routes/components intact.",

  "frontend/src/pages/DailyPlanner.tsx": "Daily planner page updated to support couple mode — when the user is in a couple, the page renders a two-tab layout (\"My Planner\" / \"Partner's Planner\") using Tabs components. The partner tab shows a read-only `PartnerPlannerView` component displaying the partner's schedule, tasks, water intake, mood, gratitude, notes, and journal entry for the selected date, fetched via `usePartnerDailyPlannerForDate`. No edit controls are shown in the partner view.",
  "frontend/src/pages/CoupleSettings.tsx": "Couple settings page with full disconnect-and-reconnect flow — the \"Disconnect from Partner\" button opens a confirmation AlertDialog that calls `useDissolveCouple`, shows an inline loading spinner during the call, displays typed error feedback if it fails, and on success closes the dialog and transitions the UI to the partner-connection form so the user can immediately link to a new partner.",
  "frontend/src/pages/YearlyPlanner.tsx": "Yearly Planner page with left/right arrow year navigation, Word of the Year input, 5 major goals with checkboxes, vision image URLs, 12-month habit tracker grid, and year-end reflection — with couple mode support.

Partner view shows all four journal types read-only with date navigation via `useGetPartnerJournals`.",
